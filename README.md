# SQL_MEXICO_TOY_STORE_PROJECT
This is a simple SQL project showing Sales, Profit and Inventory analysis of a fictitious toy Store Chain in Mexico
We have the sales & inventory data along with
store and product information for a fictitious toy store
chain in Mexico.
The data shows more than 800,000 transaction from
January 1st, 2017 to September 30th, 2018
The objective is to prepare the data, analyze and
visualize it, and subsequently outline findings which
allow the toy store chain to enhance its decision-
making capabilities

**DATA MODEL**
The Database has 4 tables as shown in the previous slide.
Products and Stores are the data tables with Primary Keys
named Product ID and Store ID respectively.
Inventory is also a data table with composite primary keys
Store ID and Product ID . Store ID and Product ID of Inventory
table are connected to the primary keys, named - Store ID of
Stores Table and Product ID of Products table
Sales table has primary key named Sale ID. The foreign keys
being Store ID and Product ID -connected to the primary keys,
named - Store ID of Stores Table and Product ID of Products
table

**Revenue – COGS- Profit Margin – Total Quantity Ordered**
The Store Chain earned a revenue of $14
million.
The Profit is more than $4 million
The Cost incurred for the Store Chain is
around $10.4 million
The company has an overall profit margin of
around 28% which also matches the ideal
profit margin of a Retail Toy Store
Mexico Toy Store has sold more than 1
million units of products from January 2017
till September 2018

**SALES AND % CHANGE IN SALES OVER THE PERIODOFTIME**
The Toy Store has experienced a growth since January 2017 to September 2018 on overall basis. As per analysis there is a positive trend
found in the sales. The way sales gone up in the month of March - April in 2017, same pattern could be found around March in 2018 as well.
Also, we could see a rise in sales in the month of November and December in 2017 probably because of the Christmas Eve. However, the
MoM change seems to be volatile. Need to check the Economic factors or market condition during the summer months to manage
budgeting, inventory etc

**SALES AND PROFIT ANALYSIS**
Toys and Art & Crafts categories drive more than 50% of total revenue. At the same time, it could be seen that Electronics and
Games are having a relatively high Profit Margin
Importantly the same categories are also the popular one across the stores & location in terms of profit and revenue.

As per overall analysis, Leg Bricks, Colorbuds, Action
Figure, Magic Sandare among top 5 products both in
terms of Sales and Profit
For Toys Category - Lego Bricks and Action Figures are
responsible for lion’s share of Profit. For Electronics
Category Colorbuds constitutes a huge share of profit of
more than $834 K for the company

The Store has 50 outlets across 29 different cities in Mexico. Downtown is the most popular store location having high density of
population.
More than 50% profit is being generated from Downtown area itself
However, a closer look states that among 3 stores in Airport area 2 are generating topmost revenue for the Toy store chain. Hence further
study should be done by Marketing Team to realize whether to expand the business over there to optimize sales

**INVENTORY ANALYSIS**
As on September 30, 2018, the store has 29742 products in stock which results in having $300 K
tied up in the inventory
There are a Total of 20 Products for which the inventory is 0 across 37 different Stores. Here if
we drill down further then Action Figure is a Product which falls under topmost 5 revenue
generating product. More than two stores are there where Action Figure stock is 0 and a
potential revenue loss is being incurred

As we dig dip into the sales analysis, it could be seen that there are a good number of Products having low potential to generate sales. Uno
Cards, Play foam, Monopoly are some of the Products which could not even touch the mark of $100 K revenue. after doing inventory
analysis it is clear that more than $47,000 is tied up in inventory for these products. Hence before restocking for the upcoming months, we
can let go off some of these products to maximize sales and profit

We have identified topmost 10 products which have comparatively high daily demands. As per that they need restocking within 10-15
days to meet the demand
Colorbuds, Lego Bricks, Action Figures are some of the important Product Names due to their Revenue and Profit generating capacity –
which need restocking even within 10-12 days.
Overall the Store Chain has a cumulative monthly demand of around 52,000 units of products, whereas currently it has around 29,500
units of products on hand. Even though the stock varies across the Stores and as per their demand, the analysis clearly states that
stock needs to be replenished in order to meet the demand of coming Christmas Eve of 2018
